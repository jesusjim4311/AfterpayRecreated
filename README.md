# AfterpayRecreated
Hello here is my submission for the "Recreate your Favorite Website" assignment. I decided to recreate the Afterpay website where you can purchase items and pay in 4 installments. 
I used base styling, components and features that follow boostrap format. In the future I would link the javascript file to the other files inside the <script></script> tags by linking the relative path to the file.
